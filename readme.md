# Easy Read Ids
Easy to read and write IDs for javascript applications.

Generates `mostly` unique IDs that should be easy to read and write.  ID's are
generated using a simple makeup of any of the following *or all of them!*

* Actions
* Animals
* Colors
* Adjectives
* Numbers
* Nautical Words

*That last one is a strange one, I know... I work for a ferry company :-)*
